The attached ML problem is one we give to anyone considering a position with our Data Science team. I've attached a discussion of the problem as well as the data you will use in this exercise. This is a critical part of our evaluation so send us your best and most creative work. Also, please keep track of how long it takes you to complete the test. And let me know (in writing) if you have any questions about anything and I will try to get them answered as soon as possible. Please email your completed challenge to challenge@knewton.com
